Sublime Comments
===============================================

Sass style comments for Sublime Text. This repo was forked from [Idiomatic CSS Style Comments](https://github.com/erskinedesign/Idiomatic-CSS-Comments-Snippets) with adjustments made by the Erskine team so that comments can be stripped from generated CSS without the use of another workflow.

This comment format based on Idiomatic CSS by Nicolas Gallagher (https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
